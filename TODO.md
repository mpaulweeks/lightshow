# todo

- escape to toggle header instead of button
- all the keyboard commands (with instructions in header)
  - left/right arrow to rotate
  - up/down arrow to open/close (amount dictates gradient distance, maxWidth = PI*0.9)
  - C to clone light (original will stay selected)
  - D to delete selected
  - E to hide/show circles
  - +/- to alter "hue" (cycle RGB according to displaced sin wave)
  - R to generate random layout
- re-calibrate on resize
- generate gradients on move? to make draw faster
- move helpers/logic for the above into new `light.js` file
- prisms?
